# MTR Tool Project Status

## Project Overview
A command-line application that provides a REST API interface for running MTR (My TraceRoute) commands, with asynchronous execution and formatted output.

## Implementation Status

### Core Components Status

#### 1. Console Application 
- [x] Basic application setup
- [x] Linux compatibility
- [x] Kubernetes pod support
- [x] Dual-mode operation (CLI and Server)
- [x] Command-line flags for all options

#### 2. REST API Endpoint 
- [x] `/mtr` GET endpoint implementation
- [x] Parameter handling:
  - [x] hostname (required)
  - [x] count (optional, default: 20)
  - [x] report (optional, default: false)
- [x] Input validation
- [x] Error handling
- [x] Asynchronous execution
- [x] Immediate response with request acceptance

#### 3. MTR Integration 
- [x] System MTR command execution
- [x] Asynchronous execution handling
- [x] Output parsing and formatting
- [x] Root privilege handling

#### 4. Output Formatting 
- [x] Console output formatting
- [x] Color-coding implementation:
  - [x] Red for packet loss ≥ 10%
  - [x] Yellow for latency ≥ 100ms
- [x] Results summary generation
  - [x] Key statistics extraction
  - [x] Plain language interpretation
  - [x] Notable issues highlighting

### Output Enhancement Requirements

#### 1. Readability Improvements
- [x] Add header explanations
- [x] Include unit descriptions (ms, %, etc.)
- [x] Format columns for better alignment
- [x] Add separator lines between sections

#### 2. Color Coding (Implemented)
- [x] Red highlighting for significant packet loss (≥10%)
- [x] Yellow highlighting for high latency (≥100ms)
- [x] Add legend explaining color meanings
- [x] Consider additional color indicators for other metrics

#### 3. Results Summary
- [x] Add summary section showing:
  - [x] Overall connection quality assessment
  - [x] Number of hops
  - [x] Average round-trip time
  - [x] Worst performing hops
  - [x] Packet loss hotspots
- [x] Include recommendations based on results

## Deployment Components

### 1. Kubernetes Deployment
- [x] Dockerfile creation
- [x] Required capabilities configuration
- [x] Deployment documentation

### 2. Direct Linux Installation
- [x] Dependencies documentation
- [x] Installation instructions
- [x] Running instructions
- [x] Privilege requirements documented

## Technical Specifications

### API Endpoint
```
GET /mtr
Parameters:
- hostname: string (required)
- count: integer (optional, default: 20, max: 100)
- report: boolean (optional, default: false)
```

### Command-Line Interface
```bash
# Server Mode
sudo ./mtr-tool -server -port=8080

# CLI Mode
sudo ./mtr-tool -host=google.com -count=10 -report=true
```

## Latest Updates (2025-02-23)

### Completed Features
- ✅ Basic MTR command wrapper implementation
- ✅ Raw output parsing with proper IPv6 support
- ✅ Colorized table output with correct column alignment
- ✅ Proper handling of DNS names and IP addresses
- ✅ Summary generation with worst packet loss and highest latency stats
- ✅ Project structure with Go modules
- ✅ Git repository setup with remote at github.com:thetwit4u/mtr-tool.git

### Fixed Issues
- ✅ Fixed sent count to show total attempts instead of successful pings
- ✅ Corrected loss percentage calculation
- ✅ Fixed handling of unknown hops (???)
- ✅ Removed duplicate last hop entries
- ✅ Fixed IPv6 address display in output

### Code Quality
- ✅ Removed debug logging
- ✅ Added .gitignore for project documentation
- ✅ Clean code organization with internal packages

## Next Steps
- [ ] Add tests for parsing and formatting functions
- [ ] Add documentation for installation and usage
- [ ] Consider adding configuration file support
- [ ] Consider adding output format options (JSON, CSV)

## Notes
- Core functionality is complete and working
- Focus now on improving output readability and interpretation
- Consider adding configuration options for thresholds
- Plan to add more detailed documentation for MTR interpretation
